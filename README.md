# My Mono-Repository

Welcome to my mono-repository on GitHub! This repository is where I store all my projects and experiments in one place for easy management and organization.

## What is a Mono-Repository?

A mono-repository is a single repository that contains multiple projects or codebases. This approach has become increasingly popular in recent years as it offers a number of advantages over traditional multi-repository structures, such as better code sharing, easier code reuse, and simpler dependency management.

## Projects and Experiments

This mono-repository contains all of my future projects and experiments. Each project or experiment has its own directory within the repository, and may include multiple subdirectories for different aspects of the project.
